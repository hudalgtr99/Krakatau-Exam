TCExam - TRANSLATORS

The TCExam translation process is the following:

1. download TCExam from https://github.com/tecnickcom/tcexam

2. uncompress the downloaded archive on your web root if you want install it or wherever you want if you only want to translate.

3. locate the following file: /shared/config.default/lang/language_tmx.xml

4. the "language_tmx.xml" is an XML file in TMX standard and could be edited either manually or using a compatible CAT Software (Computer Aided Translation, check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_Memory_eXchange for more information).

5. As a simpler alternative you can directly translate one of the language files located on "/cache/lang" folder.
